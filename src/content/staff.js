What he especially likes are fascinating universes of sedge-moss calcareous fens and extremely species-rich grasslands in the Carpathians. He studied plant systematics and ecology at Palacký University, Olomouc. His diploma thesis, defended in 1997, concerned wetland vegetation in the White Carpathian Mts, and was published as a monograph in 1998. PhD thesis on spring and spring fen vegetation in relation to environmental factors in the Carpathians flysh range was defended in 2002. Since 2000, appointed as a research scientist (2000-2003) and later as an assistant and associated professor. He is a mascot of the Center for Applied Plant Ecology, a virtual common workplace of Department of Botany and Zoology, Masaryk University, and Department of Vegetation Ecology, Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences.`,

Roleček on Quaternary environments. As a permanent member of the Biotým group he loves to guide and organise field excursions for Biopeople. He studied the systematic zoology and ecology at the Masaryk University. His current scientific interests include three main topics: 1) ecology of terrestrial temperate molluscs across Eurasia, 2) development of central European environments since the Last glacial maximum, and 3) ecology of macroinvertebrates of model aquatic systems. Recently he focusses on the research of ecology and palaeoecology of European fen habitats and also on modern analogies of central European full-glacial and early-Holocene ecosystems. He is attracted by the role of dispersal abilities and environmental filtering on the composition of biotic communities and the influence of historical processes on modern distribution and a long-term survival of glacial relicts and habitat specialists.`,

      `Why are there so many species of life on Earth? Why are they found where they are? How do they live together? How have they evolved? Why do they look the way they do? What do they tell us of the past and what do they suggest about the future? And how can they and humanity coexist in this finite world? These questions - and others - underlie my research. My primary focus is to understand the mechanisms which have given rise to our diverse world and the things we need to do to protect it. Just as with the parable of the Blind Men and the Elephant, the ability to detect large-scale pattern and identify potential mechanism is greatly enhanced by viewing systems through multiple lenses, preferably at different observational scales. As a result my biodiversity and ecology research represents a highly interdisciplinary course of studies that is vertically integrated from molecular genetics and taxonomy through biogeography, macroecology and theoretical ecology. All the while, I maintain an active field research program which spans thousands of study sites on three continents.`,

Na stejném pracovišti v roce 2012 obhájil i dizertační práci v oboru Botanika na téma Ekologie vrchovišť v pohořích Sudetské soustavy. Výzkumu vrchovišť českého pohraničí se věnuje nejvíce i doposud, v poslední době se však zabýval i výzkumem slatiništních rašelinišť či vrchovišť jiných oblastí, především střední Evropy. Nyní se spolu s T. Peterkou, M. Hájkem a ostatními kolegy nejen z rašeliništní pracovní skupiny zabývá syntézami fytocenologických databází s rašeliništními daty a klasifikacemi evropské vegetace rašelinišť pro projekt PLADIAS. Specializace: vegetace rašelinišť, ekologie rašelinišť, vegetační změny, biologie rašeliníků, produkce a dekompozice rašeliníků, vztahy mezi různými skupinami vrchovištních organismů, klasifikace rašeliništní vegetace. Mimo rašeliništní skupinu ÚBZ pracuje také na Ústavu biologie rostlin Agronomické fakulty Mendelovy univerzity v Brně.`,

Diplomovou práci o vlivu úprav sjezdovek na diverzitu lišejníků v NP Nízke Tatry obhájila v roce 2005. Doktorská práce se zabývala změnami v synuziích terestrických lišejníků na kyselých píscích Borské nížiny (Slovensko) ve vztahu k ekologickým a klimatickým faktorům a byla obhájena v roce 2013. Od roku 2013 pracuje na Ústavu botaniky a zoologie Masarykovy university a úvazek má i na Botanickém ústavu Akademie Věd SR. Její vědecký výzkum je zaměřen na: (1) diverzitu lišejníků v celosvětovém měřítku, zejména na terestrické lišejníky rodu Cladonia a saxikolní rod Placynthium, (2) moderní přístupy v oblasti genetiky (DNA-barcoding, NGS) a ekologii (studium mycobionta a fotobionta, co-evoluce), (3) ochranu přírody.`,
